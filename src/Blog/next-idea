Programming as a Second Language
why I'm glad I learnt / taught a second language

- Here are some ways teaching ESL and learning Russian have helped me with coding

- There will never be one correct way
  - In English, word order is strict. Their position in the sentence often gives them their meaning
  - In Russian, declension / conjugation gives the meaning, and word order can be more fluid
  - Bottom line: the 'best way' will likely be to speak the language your colleagues best understand.
    Instead of having them all learn your preferences, look to learn the common 'lingua de franca'

- Be concise
  - When teaching, fewer words are often better. A long sentence can often mask the important word or
    words that the students should focus in on.
  - Remember, you're writing in a language foreign to you - your audience will read this in a language
    foreign to them, and they'll read it many times.
  - Think about what you want to say, and why you're saying it.
  - Embellishments, if required, are easy enough to add later

- When reading, skim through the noise to get to the real signal
  - How hard are you concentrating when you're listening to your friend tell you about their weekend
    or reading a work of fiction?
  - Listening to the radio in Russian, I had to simply trust that I didn't need every single word
  - You should still be able to get the main points at a skim - you can then look for detail when you
    need it
