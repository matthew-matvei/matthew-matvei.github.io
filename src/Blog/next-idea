Programming as a Second Language
why I'm glad I learnt / taught a second language

- When reading, skim through the noise to get to the real signal
  - How hard are you concentrating when you're listening to your friend tell you about their weekend
    or reading a work of fiction?
  - Listening to the radio in Russian, I had to simply trust that I didn't need every single word
  - You should still be able to get the main points at a skim - you can then look for detail when you
    need it

- Also helps with
  - Discussing technical things with non-technicals
