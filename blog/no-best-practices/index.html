                    We've all had that argument with another developer where we've reasonably laid out our position why
                    it would be a good idea to do something, only to be met with 'Yes, but best practice...'
                </p>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    and that's all they need to say. And how can you respond to that? 'Sure, then I want to do something
                    less than best' hardly wins anyone over. They've said the relevant buzzword and we can now just
                    switch off our brains and do what the main on the Internet told us to do. If you've never had this
                    conversation before, congratulations.

                    For me, however, experience in this conversation brings me to my first ðŸ˜“ blargh post. I want to
                    show you that there are no strictly <em>best</em> practices and remind you that everything really
                    does depend on the situation.

                <h3>1. Commenting</h3>
                <h4>Everyone's favourite past-time</h4>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    My last workplace had a severely pro-commenting culture, with rules for commenting
                    <code>private</code> methods and simple object properties. This led to wonders such as...
                </p>

                <pre><code>
                    /// &lt;summary&gt;
                    /// Returns the current value of this object.
                    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
                    /// &lt;returns&gt;The current value of this object&lt;/returns&gt;
                    public int GetValue() =>
                        this.Value;
                </code></pre>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    with more text explaining than doing, regardless of whether the code is already completely
                    unambiguous. Worse still, this can easily be...
                </p>

                <pre><code>
                    /// &lt;summary&gt;
                    /// Returns the current value of this object.
                    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
                    /// &lt;returns&gt;The current value of this object&lt;/returns&gt;
                    public int GetValue() =>
                        this.Value ?? throw new InvalidOperationException();
                </code></pre>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    at which point, the comments don't even mention the most surprising <em>feature</em> about this
                    method, which is that if it's called when <code>this.Value</code> is <code>null</code> then we're
                    gonna explode!
                </p>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    On the other side of this spectrum is my current workplace, which strictly believes that all code
                    should be self-descriptive enough to not warrant any comments, ever. And there are some good
                    reasons:
                </p>

                <ul class="collection">
                    <li class="collection-item">
                        <p>Programmers will barely read your code, let alone the comments that go with it</p>
                        <p>
                            We deal with tight deadlines and a lot of words to process. I am human, and if there are
                            reasonable shortcuts to take, I'll take them. First things first, you're well-versed yet
                            untestable code comments.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="collection-item">
                        <p>The compiler can never know whether your comments are correct anymore</p>
                        <p>
                            If you change what a JavaScript function returns without changing your JS Doc, then you're
                            no better than those that use social engineering to convince old ladies you work at her
                            bank.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="collection-item">
                        <p>Maintenance costs</p>
                        <p>
                            There's no such thing as a free sandwich, and I have found myself wasting very real time
                            in order to satisfy commenting <em>standards</em> that either my workplace or university
                            had.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="collection-item">
                        <p>There's no guarantee your code will be easier to understand</p>
                        <p>
                            Walls of description can distract coders from the nuts and bolts of the code, and if the
                            comments become stale (where the code has moved on but the comment has not been updated)
                            then they only cause confusion.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    That said, there is a time and place for documentation. The more your actual code can inform this,
                    the better. For example, think how your typed API is self-documenting when you have a method...
                </p>

                <pre><code>
                    Task&lt;bool&gt; ItemExistsAsync(string itemId);
                </code></pre>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    Immediately, I know that I need to give it a <code>string</code> identifier of an item, and I can
                    <code>await</code> a <code>boolean</code> answer. Or even better, if you dabble a little more with
                    <i>functional</i> patterns.
                </p>

                <pre><code>
                    Either&lt;Error, Item&gt; GetItem(string itemId);
                </code></pre>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    From this, I can see that I'll either get an <code>Error</code> (if something went wrong) or I'll
                    get the <code>Item</code> I was looking for. This even means I don't need to dig into the bowels of
                    the method to discover that it might actually <code>throw</code> an exception (or even rely on
                    code comments to describe this to me).
                </p>
                <p class="grey-text text-darken-1"><em>Cool, so what do you suggest?</em></p>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    I'm glad you asked. I would consider the following when determining whether you should use comments
                    or not.
