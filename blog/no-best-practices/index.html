                    We've all had that argument with another developer where we've reasonably laid out our position why
                    it would be a good idea to do something, only to be met with 'Yes, but best practice...'

                    and that's all they need to say. And how can you respond to that? 'Sure, then I want to do something
                    less than best' hardly wins anyone over. They've said the relevant buzzword and we can now just
                    switch off our brains and do what the main on the Internet told us to do. If you've never had this
                    conversation before, congratulations.

                    For me, however, experience in this conversation brings me to my first 😓 blargh post. I want to
                    show you that there are no strictly <em>best</em> practices and remind you that everything really
                    does depend on the situation.

                <h3>1. Commenting</h3>
                <h4>Everyone's favourite past-time</h4>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    My last workplace had a severely pro-commenting culture, with rules for commenting
                    <code>private</code> methods and simple object properties. This led to wonders such as...
                </p>

                <pre class="language-cs"><code>
                    /// &lt;summary&gt;
                    /// Returns the current value of this object.
                    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
                    /// &lt;returns&gt;The current value of this object&lt;/returns&gt;
                    public int GetValue() =>
                        this.Value;
                </code></pre>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    with more text explaining than doing, regardless of whether the code is already completely
                    unambiguous. Worse still, this can easily be...
                </p>

                <pre class="language-cs"><code>
                    /// &lt;summary&gt;
                    /// Returns the current value of this object.
                    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
                    /// &lt;returns&gt;The current value of this object&lt;/returns&gt;
                    public int GetValue() =>
                        this.Value ?? throw new InvalidOperationException();
                </code></pre>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    at which point, the comments don't even mention the most surprising <em>feature</em> about this
                    method, which is that if it's called when <code>this.Value</code> is <code>null</code> then we're
                    gonna explode!
                </p>

                <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/13d2jHlSlxklVe/giphy.gif" alt="explosions" />

                <p class="flow-text">
                    On the other side of this spectrum is my current workplace, which strictly believes that all code
                    should be self-descriptive enough to not warrant any comments, ever. And there are some good
                    reasons:
                </p>

                <ul class="collection">
                    <li class="collection-item">
                        <p>Programmers will barely read your code, let alone the comments that go with it</p>
                        <p>
                            We deal with tight deadlines and a lot of words to process. I am human, and if there are
                            reasonable shortcuts to take, I'll take them. First things first, you're well-versed yet
                            untestable code comments.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="collection-item">
                        <p>The compiler can never know whether your comments are correct anymore</p>
                        <p>
                            If you change what a JavaScript function returns without changing your JS Doc, then you're
                            no better than those that use social engineering to convince old ladies you work at her
                            bank.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="collection-item">
                        <p>Maintenance costs</p>
                        <p>
                            There's no such thing as a free sandwich, and I have found myself wasting very real time
                            in order to satisfy commenting <em>standards</em> that either my workplace or university
                            had.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="collection-item">
                        <p>There's no guarantee your code will be easier to understand</p>
                        <p>
                            Walls of description can distract coders from the nuts and bolts of the code, and if the
                            comments become stale (where the code has moved on but the comment has not been updated)
                            then they only cause confusion.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    That said, there is a time and place for documentation. The more your actual code can inform this,
                    the better. For example, think how your typed API is self-documenting when you have a method...
                </p>

                <pre class="language-cs"><code>
                    Task&lt;bool&gt; ItemExistsAsync(string itemId);
                </code></pre>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    Immediately, I know that I need to give it a <code>string</code> identifier of an item, and I can
                    <code>await</code> a <code>boolean</code> answer. Or even better, if you dabble a little more with
                    <i>functional</i> patterns.
                </p>

                <pre class="language-cs"><code>
                    Either&lt;Error, Item&gt; GetItem(string itemId);
                </code></pre>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    From this, I can see that I'll either get an <code>Error</code> (if something went wrong) or I'll
                    get the <code>Item</code> I was looking for. This even means I don't need to dig into the bowels of
                    the method to discover that it might actually <code>throw</code> an exception (or even rely on
                    code comments to describe this to me).
                </p>
                <p class="grey-text text-darken-1"><em>Cool, so what do you suggest?</em></p>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    I'm glad you asked. I would consider the following when determining whether you should use comments
                    or not.
                </p>

                <ul class="collection">
                    <li class="collection-item">
                        <p>Is the code understandable without it?</p>
                        <p>
                            This can be difficult, since it'll always be understandable to the author, which is why
                            a code review process can be very useful.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="collection-item">
                        <p>Can I make things clearer by refactoring?</p>
                        <p>
                            If there's a certain <code>if</code> condition that makes people's eyes bleed and scratch
                            their heads, then perhaps you can assign that condition to a named function.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="collection-item">
                        <p>How accessible is the code to the caller?</p>
                        <p>
                            Consider whether the caller of some code is able to see it. For example, a
                            <code>private</code> method will be called from within the same class, so if a developer is
                            working on the caller, they will have full access to it. If you're writing the outer API
                            of some library code (or, using OpenAPI, documenting a HTTP API) there'll likely be more
                            value in commenting, since the consumer perhaps won't be able to peer into the code as
                            easily.
                        </p>

                <h3>2. Get defensive</h3>
                <h4>Trust no one</h4>

                <img class="responsive-img" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/32b3S2YQbby2A/giphy.gif"
                    alt="shift-eyes" />

                <p class="flow-text">
                    It's generally considered best practice to not trust the calling code, and to always check your
                    arguments. But while you might not trust the guy down the street, do you trust your neighbours?
                    It isn't completely black and white, and some thought should be given to how defensive you need to
                    be.
                </p>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    I've seen, for example, code imitated by the following in a web application that uses Dependency
                    Injection to provide dependencies:
                </p>

                <pre class="language-cs"><code>
                    public MyService(
                        object depA,
                        object depB,
                        object depN
                    )
                    {
                        this.depA = depA ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(depA));
                        this.depB = depB ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(depB));
                        this.depN = depN ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(depN));
                    }
                </code></pre>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    Since it was expected behaviour of the <code>MyService</code> class to <code>throw</code> if any of
                    its dependencies were <code>null</code>, this of course came with unit tests verifying this expected
                    behaviour.
                </p>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    Within the context of web-application code (where a consumer of your application typically
                    communicates via HTTP), this code isn't really library code and a developer designing this class is
                    likely going to be in a position to check the calling code. Also, keeping that same context in mind,
                    we know we're in a position where the dependencies are guaranteed by our DI framework to be resolved
                    and delivered; if a dependency cannot be resolved from the DI container, then with our setup an
                    exception will be thrown and the <code>MyService</code> class will not be constructed.
                </p>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    So you <em>could</em> see these checks as redundant. And whilst C# (above) let's you tidy this up
                    with the null coalescing (<code>??</code>) operator, in some other languages this can become more
                    distracting. There are two main ends of the spectrum to be on with this.
                </p>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    You could say <b>I trust no one</b>, and I can't guarantee that this class will always be resolved
                    through Dependency Injection. Even then, we may switch DI frameworks, the standard behaviour may
                    be different and we might end up trying to construct this class with <code>null</code> dependencies.
                </p>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    You could also say <b>Take responsibility when calling me</b>, and decide that if a caller has
                    attempted to manually construct this class with a <code>null</code> dependency, then they've
                    violated the class' type contract (which asks in this example case for an <code>object</code>, not
                    an <code>object</code> <em>or</em> <code>null</code>) and can no longer have any expectations about
                    its behaviour.
                </p>

                <p class="flow-text">
                    There's truth in both positions. It may be better in your situation to put responsibility on the
                    caller in order to minimise the bloat and complexity of this class, allowing it to evolve faster
                    (I've given an example of a <code>class</code>' constructor, but this can apply to any of its
                    methods' arguments, including complex object arguments). Or it may be, particularly if you're
                    writing deeper-level library code, more appropriate to guard against every inch of input you get
                    from calling code.
