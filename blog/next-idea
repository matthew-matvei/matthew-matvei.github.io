How not to do microservices
    Distributed death

- Jump on the band-wagon
    - Invalid reasons in the first place
    - Likely not to commit to the harder parts of microservices

- Don't worry about what the business needs
    - We've got all these cool toys to play with, who cares about a solid, coherent business plan

- Don't invest in your CI / CD strategy
    - You're going to deploy often, so programmers will have plenty of practice manually kicking off / managing / configuring deployments
    - Our strategy was rock solid when we had 2 services, so it should be fine with 20 right?

- Deploy more individual services than you have teams available to work on them
    - Outside specific scalability / performance reasons, do you need this new service to be independently deployed?
    - If this new service doesn't find a suitable home, will it become a bastard microservice?
    - A huge advantage of microservices is teams not having to work over each other; if that isn't an issue, why create this lone service?

- Forget about Conway's Law and don't have people siloed into 'teams'
    - Who cares if team autonomy is one of the major cornerstones / potential advantages of microservices? We need to shovel people around to maximise their usefulness
    - We don't have enough people to support isolatable teams (so why the f**k are you doing microservices?)
    - We wanted to improve communication, and having no clear team division, with everyone asking everyone else how not to break unrelated components of the system
        certainly raises the volume in the office

- Leave integration testing for now
    - It's difficult to automate and much easier to do manually at first
    - Lengthy integration / smoke tests will only slow down our progress

- Don't worry about how users will see this application
    - We're doing microservices with loose coupling, so it's fine if we have a UI that talks to 80% of our services
    - A compositional UI is difficult and takes time, better to stick with a monolithic UI... monoliths are easier?
