        If suicide by cop doesn't take your fancy, perhaps you'd like to hear about micro services: Distributed Death.
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
        There are many possible advantages in splitting up the old monolith and adopting a micro services-based
        architecture, but there are as many (if not more) pitfalls. Some are transparent, some are opaque, some are
        <em>business-y</em>, some are technical, but all can come back to put an end to you (and your cool new micro
        services-based app).
      </p>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Jump on the band wagon</h3>
      <p class="flow-text">
        There have certainly been enough bandwagons already in tech; the Enterprise Service Bus, the Cloud, the whole
        Object-Oriented Programming thing - so it's curious why we haven't gotten better at realising that the next
        thing won't solve all our problems.
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
        So when you're planning your next to-do list app, you might be thinking ahead to how you'll scale this out to
        millions, no wait, <em>trillions</em> of users. You'll likely then choose micro services, knowing that they're
        critical in being able to scale to stupid-large volumes of traffic, a la <a
          href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/bringing-pokemon-go-to-life-on-google-cloud">Pok&eacute;mon
          Go</a>. And before you know it, you've got a separate <code class="language-markup">ToDoService</code>,
        <code class="language-markup">ReminderService</code> and <code
          class="language-markup">ToDoRecommendationService</code>. About a year after you release your product you have
        earnt yourself a solid 1.5% of the market share, with 1000's of people around the country using your app daily.
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
        And you come to realise you've completely over-engineered your application, because your were focused on a
        conclusion, that everyone and their dog will want to use this app, before you had any data to indicate that.
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
        If you're getting into micro services because you feel it's almost an expectation now then you're already in it
        for the wrong reasons. It's likely you'll be excited about its potential to scale, and be forgetting that
        there's more benefit in its ability to scale <em>teams</em>, not just <em>software</em>. If you're operating a
        company that doesn't have enough people to fill those teams, you're going to waste all that actual potential.
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
        You're also less likely to really have your heart set on a micro services-based solution, warts and all. More
        difficult aspects, such as deciding how to deal with cascading failures that can negatively impact autonomous
        teams are likely to get shelved in favour of focusing on potential throughput and other prettier things. There
        are a lot of negatives that you now need to deal with because you decided to go micro services that you're only
        going to do if you <em>know</em> that you've chosen it for a clear, demonstrable <b>need</b>.
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
        If you're not going to deal with that, then keep away.
